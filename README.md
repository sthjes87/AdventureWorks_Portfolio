## üß© Business Request

### Email from Steven ‚Äì Sales Manager:

> ‚ÄúHi all,  
> I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.  
> Essentially, we want to focus it on **how much we have sold**, **of what products**, **to which clients**, and **how it has been over time**.  
> Seeing as each sales person works on **different products and customers**, it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.  
> We measure our numbers against **budget**, so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.  
> The **budget is for 2025**, and we usually look **2 years back in time** when we do analysis of sales.  
> Let me know if you need anything else!  
> // Steven‚Äù

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tables and Transformations Overview

All SQL transformations were documented in the `SQL Queries` folder.  
Views were created in SQL Server to prepare clean, reusable data sources for Power BI.

### ‚úÖ Key transformation steps:

- `SELECT` to extract relevant columns  
- `LEFT JOIN` to integrate related dimensions  
- `REPLACE`, `CONCAT`, and `CONVERT` for field formatting  
- `WHERE` clause to define the relevant time window (2023‚Äì2024)  
- `CREATE VIEW` used instead of CSV exports, allowing scalable, automated integration and **query folding** in Power BI  
- üí° SQL was formatted using [SQL Formatter & Beautifier Online](https://codebeautify.org/sqlformatter)
