## üß© Business Request

### Email from Steven ‚Äì Sales Manager

> ‚ÄúHi all,  
> I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.  
> Essentially, we want to focus on **how much we have sold**, **of what products**, **to which clients**, and **how it has been over time**.  
> Since each salesperson works on **different products and customers**, it would be beneficial to be able to filter them as well.  
> We measure our numbers against **budget**, so I added that in a spreadsheet to compare our values against performance.  
> The **budget is for 2025**, and we usually look **2 years back** when we analyze sales.  
> Let me know if you need anything else!  
> // Steven‚Äù

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Process (SQL, Power Query, DAX)

### ‚úÖ SQL ETL Process

- Extracted relevant columns using `SELECT`
- Integrated related dimensions with `LEFT JOIN`
- Cleaned + transformed data (`REPLACE`, `CONCAT`, `CONVERT`)
- Filtered for relevant periods (`WHERE` ‚Üí 2023‚Äì2024)
- Created **SQL views** instead of CSV exports, enabling scalable, automated integration + **query folding** in Power BI
- Documented SQL scripts in the `SQL Queries` folder

### ‚úÖ Power Query (Power BI)

- Imported SQL views from SQL Server
- Applied data type transformations
- Built a custom **calendar table** for date intelligence
- Merged datasets using Power Query transformations
- Removed duplicates, cleaned nulls, standardized column names

### ‚úÖ DAX Measures

- Developed DAX measures in a dedicated **Measures Table**:
    - Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Orders
    - Average Order Value, Profit Margin, Sales vs. Budget %
    - YoY (Year-over-Year) KPIs (Revenue, Profit, Orders)
    - YTD (Year-to-Date) calculations
- Used `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, `ALL`, `DIVIDE`, `IF`, `SWITCH` for advanced logic
